        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>While Minecraft doesn't have a traditional cast of story-driven characters, here are some key entities players encounter:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Steve/Alex:</strong> The default player characters.</li>
            <li><strong>Creepers:</strong> Hostile mobs that silently approach players and explode.</li>
            <li><strong>Zombies:</strong> Common hostile mobs that attack players.</li>
            <li><strong>Skeletons:</strong> Hostile mobs that attack players with bows and arrows.</li>
            <li><strong>Enderman:</strong> Neutral mobs that can teleport and become hostile if looked directly in the eyes.</li>
            <li><strong>Villagers:</strong> Peaceful NPCs that inhabit villages and can be traded with.</li>
            <li><strong>The Ender Dragon:</strong> The final boss mob found in the End dimension.</li>
            <li><strong>The Wither:</strong> A powerful boss mob that can be summoned by players.</li>
            <li><strong>Herobrine:</strong> A popular and persistent community-created creepypasta; a ghostly figure said to resemble the default player skin with glowing white eyes. While not officially in the game, Herobrine has become a significant part of Minecraft legend.</li>
