        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with infinite terrain in Mojang Studios' sandbox game, Minecraft. 
             They can build structures, gather resources, make crafts, engage in cooperative or competitive activities, and fight mobs. 
             Players can follow a "endgame" plot and gain achievements, but there isn't a predetermined objective.  
            Experiences vary depending on the game mode:  Survival calls for resource management and threat-fighting; 
            Creative offers an endless supply of building materials; Adventure offers carefully chosen maps with goals; 
            Spectator permits passive observation; and Hardcore offers permadeath and extreme difficulty.</p>
        <p>Every new world has its own distinct biomes and structures that can be discovered. With shared creations, custom maps, mods, and 
            redstone contraptions, a sizable community improves the game and guarantees constant new experiences.</p>
